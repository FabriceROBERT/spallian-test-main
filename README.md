# **Technical test**

# Objective

Create a quick React application which consume an API and display the results.

You **must** fork this project, link to your gitlab/github account, and commit to your account on a public repository.

You can choose any API you want as long as JSON is returned.  
If you don't have any ideas of API, you can choose between any of these one:

https://openweathermap.org  
https://pokeapi.co/  
https://swapi.dev/

You will be evaluated on :

- How you structure the project
- How you fetch the data
- How you transform the data to display it

## Prohibited:

- Any external help except Google
- The use of CSS frameworks (tailwind, bootstrap, etc...), CSS **must** be vanilla

## Recommendations:

- Librairies are recommended but not necessary:
  - React Router in case you need it
  - React Query to fetch the data
  - anything you want except CSS framework

## Bonus:

- Get deeper in how you fetch the data (filters, pagination, etc...)
